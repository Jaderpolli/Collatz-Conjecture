    #= to create the initial condition you should think if you want it to be constructed
    randomically or from periodic primes building blocks.
    In order to have an estimation of the size of the initial condition in base 10 you
    should consider the following formulas:

        for type=Prime: log_2(n_0) = vecsize/blocksize sum(primes of building block)

        for type=Random: log_2(n_0) â‰ˆ vecsize[(maxrand+1)/2]

    this might help you to create your own initial conditions if you don't want to use
    the ones from the "RAW_DATA/INITIAL_CONDITIONS/" directory
